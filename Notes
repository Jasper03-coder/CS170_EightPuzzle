    - must have access to the blanks current row and current col
    - we must somehow create a new node with the updated matrix following the specific operator
    - we can use swapTiles function in the Node structure, but should it be void or return a new node
    - should we return anything (void, Node*, bool, vector<vector<int>>)
        - if we move the blank we will have a new puzzle so we either return a vector<vector<int>> or return a new node
        - if we return a vector we would have to create a new node but the new node needs its parent so we must return a new Node*
            from the operator function
    - must update the row or column after specific operator so we know where the blank is now

        
        1. Type of function
            - if void, then how do we gain access to the current node outside this helper function. We can't so this is not an option
            - in the operator function, we would have to create a new node if the operator is a valid move
            - if Node*, we solve the issue of having access to the new Node after a valid operator move

        
        2. Need to check if the operator is a valid move at the blanks current position
            - need the blank's row, or
            - need the blank's column
            - if it is not valid we can return nullptr
            - if it is we can continue to create a new node
        
        3. The operator is a valid move:

            - we need to create a new node with the updated puzzle after the specific operator move
            - how should we go about this using the swapTiles function in Node

                - if swapTiles() returns a vector, then in the function itself, it should make 
                    a copy of the currNodes puzzle, then swap the tiles in that vector, then return the copy. 
                    then we can pass it through as the first argument in initializing the new Node

                - if it is void, then in the operator function, we should make a new node with the same puzzle as the 
                    current node and after creating the new node, then we can swap the tiles in the new node

            - since the move is valid and the blank tile moves. We need to update the row/column according to whichever operator move was made
